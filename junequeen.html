(Verse 1)
You laugh, the room comes back to life,
You walk in, and the world feels light.
Not trying hard to take the scene,
Yet somehow still, you're the June Queen.

(Chorus)
Hey, I just thought you should know,
You light up the dark like a glow.
No drama, no staged routine —
Just warm vibes from your quiet fan team.
You're cool, you're kind, you're real —
That’s the crown no one can steal.

(Verse 2)
You don’t need sparkle to stand tall,
You shine with no flash at all.
Hearts feel calm when you're around,
Like morning sun without a sound.

(Chorus)
Hey, I just thought you should know,
You light up the dark like a glow.
No pressure, no hidden scheme —
Just soft truth from a silent dream.
You're cool, you're kind, you're real —
That’s the crown no one can steal.

(Bridge)
You don’t see the way you glow,
But it’s clear to those who know.
Grace in steps, calm in fire,
You lift the world, then walk off higher.

(Subtle Birthday Verse)
And if today feels oddly bright,
Like skies are painted extra light,
Maybe it's the kind of day —
Where time just stops to look your way.

(Outro)
So if this tune finds your ears one day,
May it color your skies when they turn gray.
No big message, no hidden move —
Just a song for you… my June Queen groove.
